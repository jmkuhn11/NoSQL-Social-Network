# NoSQL-Social-Network

## Development

In the event that I create a social media startup, or a similar platform that requires storing a lot of information, I wanted to create a system using a NoSQL database. This would allow for many users to interact and comment on various topics with their friends, all without the worry of their personal information leaking or a system crash from overworking. Through creating this project, I gained a better understanding of how to use Insomnia, MongoDB and Mongoose, and NoSQL for future projects. I also am working towards feeling comforatble with routing and presenting more varities of data for clients to use, as the more comfortable with coding I get, the more options I can provide.

## Installation

To run this application, you will have needed to download VSC, Insomnia, and MongoDB/Mongoose. On VSC for the server to run proper;y you will also need Express.js and Mongoose packages in the package json.

## Usage

One would make sure they have installed all of the required applications and VSC dependencies before opening the terminal and inputting "npm run start". This will start their server, and allow them to head over to Insomnia to work with all of the available data. First they can use a GET function to look at the various users and thoughts that have been created. They can also post more users and thoughts as well. Once finding the ID for various users and thoughts, they can then continue to update and delete data. Once understanding the basic structure of the site, they can then try out adding/deleting friends to their friend list and reactions to others' thoughts.
